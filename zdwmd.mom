Remove the border between mind and matter:
everything important should be as few keypresses as possible away from you,
and you shouldn't have to think about what you're doing.
Immersion.
.ITEM
\fBEconomy\fP \(en
Programs should be simple and light on system resources and highly extensible.
Because of this, many are terminal or small ncurses programs that have all the magic inside of them.

\fBKeyboard/vim-centrality\fP \(en
All terminal programs (and other programs) use vim keys when possible.
Your hands never need leave the home row or thereabout.

This system is a web of small, modifiable and replaceable programs that users can easily customize.

.HEADING 2 "General keyboard changes"

.LI

Capslock is a useless key in high quality space.
It's now remapped.
If you press it alone, it will function as escape, making vimcraft much more natural,
but you can also hold it down and it will act as another Windows/super/mod key.
.ITEM
The menu button (usually between the right Alt and Ctrl) is an alternative Super/Mod button.
This is to make one-handing on laptops easier.

If you'd like to change any of these keyboard changes, you need only open and change the \f(CWremaps\fP script.
Actually, this should go without saying, but \fIeverything\fP here can easily be changed.
Below in this document, there is information about where to change programs/components.

Additionally, while this isn't a part of the desktop environment, the default editing mode in the shell is using vi bindings.
If you want to learn more of this, run \f(CWMod+F2\fP and type and select the option for "vi mode in shell".
This setting can be changed if you don't like it by deleting or commenting out the contents of \f(CW~/.config/inputrc\fP.

.HEADING 1 "Key Bindings"

The window manager dwm abstractly orders all of your windows into a stack from most important to least based on when you last manipulated it.
dwm is an easy to use window manager, but you should understand that it makes use of that stack layout.
If you're not familiar, I recommend you press \f(CWMod+F2\fP and select the "dwm" option to watch my brief tutorial (note that the bindings I discuss in the video are the default dwm binds, which are different (inferior) to those here).
.PP
Notice also the case sensitivity of the shortcuts\c
.FOOTNOTE
To type capital letters, hold down the \f(CWShift\fP key\(emthat might sound like an obvious and condescending thing to tell you, but there have literally been multiple people (Boomers) who have emailed me asking how to type a capital letter since caps lock isn't enabled.

Additionally, I've set vim to use the clipboard as the default buffer, which means when you yank or delete something in vim, it will be in your system clipboard as well, so you can \f(CWctrl-v\fP it into your browser instance, etc. You can also paste material copied from other programs into vim with the typical vim bindings.

.HEADING 2 "How do I set up my music?"

.PP
By default, mpd, the music daemon assumes that \f(CW~/Music\fP is your music directory.
This can be changed in \f(CW~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf\fP.
When you add music to your music folder, you may have to run \f(CWmpc up\fP in the terminal to update the database.
mpd is controlled by ncmpcpp, which is accessible by \f(CWMod+m\fP.
